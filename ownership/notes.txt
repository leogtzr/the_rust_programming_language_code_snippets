Data with an unknown size at compile time or a size that might change must be stored on the heap instead.

Ownership Rules

First, let’s take a look at the ownership rules. Keep these rules in mind as we work through the examples that illustrate them:

    There can only be one owner at a time.
    When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
